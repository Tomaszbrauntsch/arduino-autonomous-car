This project is a car that can drive by it's self and is powered with an Arduino
I started this project in November 2018 around the starting the 5th... approximately for my Robotics class

Hardware / The parts that are needed are:
Arduino Uno
Bunch of jumper cables
Ultrasonic Sensor
Two Servo Motors w/ Wheels and an additional two wheels for it to move like a car
AC to 9v battery adapter (powering the arduino to make it more portable and more "wireless")
Small Breadboard
USB Cable (transfer code from the PC to the Board)

Software:
Arduino Software to program the Arduino
